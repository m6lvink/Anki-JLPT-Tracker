# JLPT Progress Tracker

A passion project created to visualize my progress towards certain JLPT levels based on the 'average' medium for each level. 

## Installation

1. Copy the jlpt_tracker folder to your Anki addons folder
2. Restart Anki
3. Go to Tools > JLPT Progress to open the dashboard

## Features

- Shows progress bars for each JLPT level (N5 to N1)
- Tracks vocab and grammar separately
- Click on any level to see detailed progress
- Compares your cards to JLPT requirements

## How It Works

The add-on counts cards in your current deck and categorizes them as:
- Grammar: cards with "grammar" tag or note type
- Vocab: all other cards

Progress is calculated by comparing your counts to standard JLPT requirements.

## Customization

Edit config.json to adjust JLPT level requirements.

## Future Enhancements

- Time implementation to count down to the exam
- Historical progress tracking
- Multiple deck support
- Export progress data
- More detailed categorization
